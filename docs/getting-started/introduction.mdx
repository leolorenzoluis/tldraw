Welcome to the tldraw developer docs.

Here at tldraw, we make two things: a very good multiplayer whiteboard (at [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com)), and the [open source library](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) that powers it. This page provides documentation and reference for that open source library.

```tsx 
import { Tldraw } from '@abc.xyz/tldraw'
import '@abc.xyz/tldraw/tldraw.css'

export default function () {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw />
		</div>
	)
}
```

You can use the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) React component to build on top of the default tldraw experience. It's easy to use and easy to extend with your own [custom shapes](/docs/shapes), [custom tools](/docs/tools), and [user interface](/docs/user-interface) overrides. 

You can also use the [Editor API](/docs/editor) to create, update, and delete shapes, control the camera, or do just about anything else.

If you want to go even deeper, you can use the [`<TldrawEditor>`](/gen/editor/TldrawEditor) component as a more minimal engine without the default tldraw shapes or user interface.


Best of all, you can easily plug tldraw into the [collaboration backend](/docs/collaboration) of your choice.

- Want to explore the code? Visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).
- Want to try it out? Visit the [examples sandbox](https://stackblitz.com/github/tldraw/tldraw/tree/examples?file=src%2F1-basic%2FBasicExample.tsx).

Otherwise, continue on to the [installation](/docs/installation) and [usage](/docs/usage) guides.
