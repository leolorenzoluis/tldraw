In order to use the [`<Tldraw/>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component, the app must be able to find certain assets. These are contained in the `embed-icons`, `fonts`, `icons`, and `translations` folders. We offer a few different ways of making these assets available to your app.

### 1. Using a public CDN

By default we serve these assets from a [public CDN called unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/@abc.xyz/assets@2.0.0-alpha.12/), so everything should work out of the box and is a good way to get started.

If you would like to customize some of the assets you can pass the customizations to our [`<Tldraw/>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component. For example, to use a custom icon for the `hand` tool you can do the following:

```javascript
const assetUrls = {
    icons: {
        'tool-hand': './custom-tool-hand.svg',
    },
}

<Tldraw assetUrls={assetUrls} />
```

This will use the custom icon for the `hand` tool and the default assets for everything else.


### 2. Hosting the assets yourself

If you want more flexibility you can also host these assets yourself:
1. Download the `embed-icons`, `fonts`, `icons`, and `translations` folders from the [assets folder](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/assets) of the tldraw repository.
2. Place the folders in your project's public path.
3. Pass `assetUrls` prop to our `<Tldraw/>` component to let the component know where the assets live. 

You can use our `getAssetUrls` helper function from the `@abc.xyz/assets` package to generate these urls for you.
```javascript
import { getAssetUrls } from '@abc.xyz/assets/selfHosted'

const assetUrls = getAssetUrls()

<Tldraw assetUrls={assetUrls} />
```

While these files must be available, you can overwrite the individual files: for example, by placing different icons under the same name or modifying / adding translations.

If you use a CDN for hosting these files you can specify the base url of your assets. To recreate the above option of serving the assets from unpkg you would do the following:

```javascript
const assetUrls = getAssetUrls({
    baseUrl: 'https://unpkg.com/@abc.xyz/assets@2.0.0-alpha.12/',
})
```

### 3. Using a bundler

If you're using a bundler like webpack or rollup, you can import the assets directly from the `@abc.xyz/assets` package. Here you can use `getAssetUrlsByMetaUrl` helper function:
```javascript
import { getAssetUrlsByMetaUrl } from '@abc.xyz/assets/urls'

const assetUrls = getAssetUrlsByMetaUrl()

<Tldraw assetUrls={assetUrls} />
```

### Adding custom assets

We have plans to offer more rich asset customizations in the future (e.g. custom cursors, custom fonts, translations for other languages etc).
