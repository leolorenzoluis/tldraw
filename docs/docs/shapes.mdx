## Introduction

In tldraw, a **shape** is something that can exist on the page, like an arrow, an image, or some text.

This article is about shapes: what they are, how they work, and how to create your own shapes. If you'd prefer to see an example, see the tldraw repository's [examples app](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/tree/main/apps/examples) for examples of how to create custom shapes in tldraw.

## Types of shape

The editor comes with some built-in [**core shapes**](/gen/editor/coreShapes), like the [text shape](/gen/tlschema/TLTextShape), the [group shape](/gen/tlschema/TLGroupShape) and more. These are required for the editor to work, so they can't be removed.

There are also some [**default shapes**](/gen/editor/defaultShapes) available, like the [arrow shape](/gen/tlschema/TLArrowShape), the [draw shape](/gen/tlschema/TLDrawShape), and more. The [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/editor/Editor) component provides access to these shapes automatically.

You can also create your own **custom shapes**. Find more information about that [below](#custom-shapes).

## Inside a shape

Shapes are just JSON objects that sit in the [store](/docs/editor#store).

Every shape contains some **base information**. These include the shape's type, position, rotation, opacity, and more. You can find the full list of base properties [here](/gen/tlschema/TLBaseShape).

```js
const shape = editor.getShape('some-shape-id')
if (shape) {
  shape.type    // The shape's type
  shape.opacity // The shape's opacity
}
```

Every shape also contains some **shape-specific information**. We call these `props`. For example, the text shape has a [text prop](/gen/tlschema/textShapeProps), the arrow shape has a [start and end prop](/gen/tlschema/arrowShapeProps), and so on.

```js
const textShape = editor.getShape('some-text-shape-id')
if (textShape) {
  textShape.props.text // The shape's text
  textShape.props.font // The shape's font
}
```

## Shape util

While tldraw's shapes themselves are simple JSON objects, we use [`ShapeUtil`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil) classes to answer questions about shapes. For example, when the editor needs to know the bounding box of a text shape, it will find the [`TextShapeUtil`](/gen/editor/TextShapeUtil) and call its [`getBounds`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil#getBounds) method, passing in the text shape object as an argument.

```JavaScript
const util = this.getShapeUtil(myShape)
if (util) {
  const bounds = util.getBounds(myShape)
  bounds) // The shape's bounding box
}
```

## Custom shapes

You can create your own **custom shapes**. As an example, let's create a custom "card" shape. It'll be a simple rectangle with some text inside.

### Shape type

In tldraw's data model, each shape is represented by a JSON object. Let's first create a type that describes what this object will look like.

```ts
import { TLBaseShape } from '@abc.xyz/tldraw'

type CardShape = TLBaseShape<
  'card', 
  { w: number, h: number }
>
```

With the [`TLBaseShape`](/gen/editor/TLBaseShape) helper, we define the shape's `type` property (`card`) and the shape's `props` property (`{ w: number, h: number }`). The type can be any string but the props must be a regular [JSON-serializable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#description) JavaScript object.

The [`TLBaseShape`](/gen/editor/TLBaseShape) helper adds the other base properties of a shape, such as `x`, `y`, `rotation`, and `opacity`.

### Shape Util

While tldraw's shapes themselves are simple JSON objects, we use [`ShapeUtil`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil) classes to answer questions about shapes.

Let's create a [`ShapeUtil`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil) class for the shape.

```tsx
import { ShapeUtil, HTMLContainer, Box2d } from '@abc.xyz/tldraw'

class CardShapeUtil extends ShapeUtil<CardShape> {
  static type = 'card' as const

  getDefaultProps(): CardShape['props'] {
		return {
			w: 100,
			h: 100,
		}
	}

  getBounds(shape: CardShape) {
		return new Box2d(0, 0, shape.props.w, shape.props.h)
	}

  component(shape: CardShape) {
    return (
      <HTMLContainer>Hello</HTMLContainer>
    )
  }

  indicator(shape: CardShape) {
    return (
      <rect width={shape.props.w} height={shape.props.h}/>
    )
  }
}
```

This is a minimal [`ShapeUtil`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil). We've given it a static property `type` that matches the type of our shape, we've provided implementations for the abstract methods [`getDefaultProps`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil#getDefaultProps), [`getBounds`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil#getBounds), [`component`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil#component), and [`indicator`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil#indicator).

We still have work to do on the `CardShapeUtil` class, but we'll come back to it later. For now, let's put the shape onto the canvas by passing it to the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component.

### Defining the shape

Before we pass the shape down, we need to package it up in a way using the [`defineShape`](/gen/editor/defineShape) function. We can then pass an array of our defined shapes into the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component's `shapes` prop. 

```tsx
import { Tldraw } from '@abc.xyz/tldraw'
import '@abc.xyz/tldraw/tldraw.css'

const MyCardShape = defineShape('card', { util: CardShapeUtil })

export default function () {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw shapeUtils={MyCustomShapes}/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Let's create a card shape using the [`Editor`](/gen/editor/Editor) API. We'll do this by setting the `onMount` prop of the [`<Tldraw>`](/gen/tldraw/Tldraw) component.

```tsx
export default function () {
	return (
		<div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
			<Tldraw shapeUtils={MyCustomShapes} onMount={editor => {
        editor.createShapes([{  type: "card" }])
      }}/>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Once the page refreshes, we should now have our custom shape on the canvas.

## Meta information

Shapes also have a [`meta`](/gen/tlschema/TLBaseShape#meta) property that you can fill with your own data. This should feel like a bit of a hack, however it's intended to be an escape hatch for applications where you want to use tldraw's existing shapes but also want to attach a bit of extra data to the shape.

Note that tldraw's regular shape definitions have an unknown object for the shape's `meta` property. To type your shape's meta, use a union like this:

```ts
type MyShapeWithMeta = TLGeoShape & { meta: { createdBy: string } }

const shape = editor.getShape<MyShapeWithMeta>(myGeoShape.id)
```

You can update a shape's `meta` property in the same way you would update its props, using [`Editor.updateShapes`](/gen/editor/Editor#updateShapes).

```ts
editor.updateShapes<MyShapeWithMeta>([{
  id: myGeoShape.id,
  type: "geo",
  meta: {
    createdBy: "Steve"
  }
}])
```

Like [`props`](/gen/tlschema/TLBaseShape#props), the data in a shape's `meta` object must be JSON serializable.

In addition to setting meta properties this way, you can also set the default meta data for shapes using the Editor's [`getInitialMetaForShape`](/gen/editor/Editor#getInitialMetaForShape) method.

```tsx
editor.getInitialMetaForShape = (shape: TLShape) => {
  if (shape.type === 'text') {
    return { createdBy: currentUser.id, lastModified: Date.now() } 
  } else {
    return { createdBy: currentUser.id }
  }
}
```

Whenever new shapes are created using the [`createShapes`](/gen/editor/Editor#createShapes) method, the shape's meta property will be set using the [`getInitialMetaForShape`](/gen/editor/Editor#getInitialMetaForShape) method. By default this method returns an empty object.

## Using starter shapes

You can use "starter" shape utils like [`BaseBoxShapeUtil`](/gen/editor/BaseBoxShapeUtil) to get regular rectangular shape behavior.

## Flags

You can use flags like [`hideRotateHandle`](/gen/editor/ShapeUtil#hideRotateHandle) to hide different parts of the UI when the shape is selected, or else to control different behaviors of the shape.

## Interaction

You can turn on `pointer-events` to allow users to interact inside of the shape.

## Editing

You can make shapes "editable" to help decide when they're interactive or not.
